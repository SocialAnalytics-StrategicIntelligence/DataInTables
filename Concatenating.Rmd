# Concatenating Data Frames in R

Concatenating is an operation at the data frame level. It is an easy operation when all the data frames have the **same** column names, and in the same position  (vertical concatenation).

Let me bring some data frames:


```{r}
rm(list = ls())
list_of_files <- list.files(path = "FilesToConcatenate",
                            recursive = TRUE,
                            pattern = "\\P.csv$",
                            full.names = TRUE)
list_of_files
```

Now, I will create a list of data frames:


```{r}
dfs = lapply(list_of_files, read.csv)
```

Let me check if the column names are the same:


```{r}
for (df in dfs){
    print(names(df))}
```

In this situation, I need to work on the column names of the last one:


```{r}
# keep in the rigth order
dfs[[4]]['Combatants']=NA
dfs[[4]]=dfs[[4]][,c('War', 'Deathrange', 'Date', 'Combatants', 'Location', 'Notes')]
```

Let's verify:


```{r}
# do this again:
for (df in dfs)
    print(names(df))
```

Now we can append them, and count the amount of rows:


```{r}
allWars=do.call(rbind, dfs)
dim(allWars)
```



```{r}
# this is it:

head(allWars,20)
```

You can save this now. This still needs cleaning and formatting.


```{r}
# pathAndName=file.path.join('FilesToAppend','AllWars_messy_R.csv')
# allWars.to_csv(pathAndName,index=False)
```
